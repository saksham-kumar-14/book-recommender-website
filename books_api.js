        "title" : "Life 3.0",
        "description" : `The book begins by positing a scenario in which AI has exceeded human 
        intelligence and become pervasive in society. Tegmark refers to different stages of human
        life since its inception: Life 1.0 referring to biological origins, Life 2.0 referring to 
        cultural developments in humanity, and Life 3.0 referring to the technological age of humans.
        The book focuses on "Life 3.0", and on emerging technology such as artificial general 
        intelligence that may someday, in addition to being able to learn, be able to also redesign 
        its own hardware and internal structure. The first part of the book looks at the origin
        of intelligence billions of years ago and goes on to project the future development of 
        intelligence. Tegmark considers short-term effects of the development of advanced 
        technology, such as technological unemployment, AI weapons, and the quest for human-
        level AGI 
        (Artificial General Intelligence). The book cites examples like Deepmind and OpenAI, 
        self-driving cars, and AI players that can defeat humans in Chess, Jeopardy, and Go.
        After reviewing current issues in AI, Tegmark then considers a range of possible futures that
        feature intelligent machines or humans. The fifth chapter describes a number of potential 
        outcomes that could occur, such altered social structures, integration of humans and 
        machines, and both positive and negative scenarios like Friendly AI or an AI apocalypse.
        Tegmark argues that the risks of AI come not from malevolence or conscious behavior per sec,
        but rather from the misalignment of the goals of AI with those of humans. Many of the 
        goals of the book align with those of the Future of Life Institute,[6] of which Tegmark is
        a co-founder. The remaining chapters explore concepts in physics, goals, consciousness
        and meaning, and investigate what society can do to help create a desirable future for
        humanity.`,

        "title" : "Surely You are Joking Mr. Feynmen",
        "description" : `The book has many stories which are lighthearted in tone, such as his 
        fascination with safe-cracking, studying various languages, participating with groups 
        of people who share different interests (such as biology or philosophy), and ventures 
        into art and samba music.
        Other stories cover more serious material, including his work on the Manhattan Project
        (during which his first wife Arline Greenbaum died of tuberculosis) and his critique 
        of the science education system in Brazil. The section "Monster Minds" describes his 
        slightly nervous presentation of his graduate work on the Wheeler–Feynman absorber 
        theory in front of Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, Henry Norris Russell, John von 
        Neumann, and other major scientists of the time.
        The anecdotes were edited from taped conversations that Feynman had with his close friend
        and drumming partner Ralph Leighton. Its surprise success led to a sequel, What Do You Care
        What Other People Think?, also taken from Leighton's taped conversations. Surely You're 
        Joking, Mr. Feynman! became a national bestseller.
        The closing chapter, "Cargo Cult Science," is adapted from the address that Feynman gave 
        during the 1974 commencement exercises at the California Institute of Technology.
        The book's title derives from a woman's response at Princeton University when, after she
        asked the newly arrived Feynman if he wanted cream or lemon in his tea, he absentmindedly 
        requested both.`,
